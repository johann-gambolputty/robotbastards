- Terrain types
	- Dependent on elevation, slope, latitude
	- Use 2d noise (x,z) to offset type calculation
	- Each type gets their own contribution value, weighted by (e,s,l) weights
		- E(p) == elevation
		- S(p) == slope
		- L(p) == latitude
		- Te(e) == Distribution of terrain type at elevation
		- Ts(e) == Distribution of terrain type at slope
		- Tl(e) == Distribution of terrain type at latitude
		- Tc = Te(E(p)).Ts(S(p)).Tl(L(p)).Noise(p)
		- Partly finished - implemented as TerrainDistribution class

		- Works OK, but would be better if L(p) is removed, and instead add E(p) and S(p)
		for different latitude bands.

- Patch splat texturing without pixel shader U/V wrapping:
	- Patch initial visibility:
		- Determine all terrain types affecting the patch
		- There should be a maximum of N=4, possibly 6, per patch
		- If there's more than N terrain types, just use one of the existing terrain types
		- Munge terrain type byte IDs into an int32
		- Store this value in the patch (TerrainPackID)
	- Sort visible patches by TerrainPackID
	- For each visible patch in sorted list:
		- If TerrainPackID has changed from previous visible patch:
			- Load up 

- This same scheme can be used to define terrain packs, with pixel shader u/v wrapping:

- Profiling code pretty much done
	- Add bits to controls
	- Save profile logs
		- Add .exe profile viewer that can be associated with profile logs
	- Add named events?
	- Add axis to graphs
	- Add zoom in/out buttons
	- Make data page an expando control rather than a tab page
	- Add pause button
	- Add labelling to graph lines on mouse hover
	- Add sample rate up/down spinner
