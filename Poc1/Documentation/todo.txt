
- TODO
	- Particle Systems
		- H: Particle system serialization
		- H: Move particle system library and tools to RB.
		- M: Add particle field descriptor. Replace ParticleBase strings with standard field descriptors
		- M: Add some proper renderers, updaters and spawners (ongoing)
		- M: Add SSE2 parallel particle buffers
		- M: Add profiling for particle systems
		- L: Add uber-buffer/GPU-only particle systems
		- L: Add support for loading assemblies containing particle components in dynamically
	- Terrain
		- H: Terrain skirts should be generated in the direction of vertex normals. This should allow them to work with ground displacement
		- H: Force error for patches with > threshold radius
		- H: Investigate why error does not appear to be totally correct
		- M: Normalized heights returned from ground offset displacers are wrong.
		- M: Would be great to have terrain functions and terrain types defined by some function of latitude
		- M: Tangent frame at poles is incorrect
		- M: Add multi-fractals to the displacer set
		- M: Geomorphing
		- M: Add pre-process noise to the terrain texture
		- M: Cull quad tree nodes (frustum + horizon culling for spherical planets)
		- L: Change from BackgroundWorker in terrain quad patch builder, to ThreadPool
		- L: Pop slope/altitude determination in fragment shader (it's done at a vertex level - can work it out implicitly in frag shader)
		- L: Add terrain pack resolution parameter to terrain shader
	- Environment
		- L: Volumetric clouds
		- L: Vegetation
		- L: Animal life
	- Planets
		- H: Large radius planets (>1000km)
			- H: Fix larger radius planets (lots of z-fighting, no terrain detail)
			- H: combine terrain/marble rendering using z clipping planes (take a look at PSM)
		- H: Atmospheric shaders
		- M: Add planetary rings
		- M: Add moons back in
		- M: Add sun
		- M: Add light scattering post-process (god-rays)
		- L: Crater terrain function for moons
		- L: Crater terrain types for moons
		- L: Gas-giant shaders
		- L: Non-spherical planets

		- ?: Restore planet cube map (necessary?)
	- Water
		- H: Improve water rendering
			- Animated bump maps
			- Ocean swell
			- Reflections
			- Foam
			- Texture selection from depth
			- Transparency at shallow depths
		- L: Lakes
		- L: Rivers
	- Cities
		- L: Buildings
		- L: Roads
		- L: Traffic
		- L: Pedestrians
	- Solar system
		- M: Proper procedural star-spheres
	- Assets
		- L: Asset build should have a UI (progress bar, output text)
		- L: Add bigfile support
		- L: Game assets aware of changes to design objects
			- Perhaps with a service that monitors the design folders?
			- Needs following commands:
				- "Rebuild All"
				- "Build All" (only updates game assets with an earlier timestamp that design assets)
				- "ReBuild" (builds a single named asset)
				- "Build" (builds a single asset)
			- In-game UI
			- Build/Rebuild menu items
	- UI
		- H: Get tweaker variables working
		- M: Try getting WPF to work
		- M: Profiling code pretty much done
			- Profile UI needs fixed scales (adaptive scales is stupid and misleading)
			- Add bits to controls
			- Save profile logs
			- Add .exe profile viewer that can be associated with profile logs
			- Add named events?
			- Add axis to graphs
			- Add zoom in/out buttons
			- Make data page an expando control rather than a tab page
			- Add pause button
			- Add labelling to graph lines on mouse hover
			- Add sample rate up/down spinner
		- L: Ship HUD
	- Ships
		- H: Basic ship graphics
		- H: Get basic ship dynamics working
		- M: Connectors
		- M: Shaders
		- M: Simple ship combat
		- L: Internal ship modelling

	- Networking
		- H: Extend RUNT
		- H: Add WCF service for meta-server (updates, player storage, ...)
	- Tools
		- Planet Builder
			- H: Add support for loading/saving/exporting atmosphere setup
			- H: Add atmosphere tab
			- M: Allow multiple graphs to be displayed on a single graph control
			- L: Default terrain function setup should be reflected in the initial control setup
			- L: Add support for loading/saving terrain function setup
			- L: Add legend to graph control (should appear on hover over graph line)
		- Particle Builder
			- H: Add PS load/save code.
			- H: Set up particle system setup window from input particle sytem
			- M: The "Add" drop-down in composite component editor is too short when it contains only 1 item
			- M: Add Trigger updater
			- M: Create decent initial particle system
			- M: Add alpha channel to particle texture
			- M: Add switch between parallel/serial implementations
			- M: Add profiling viewers
			- L: Add shadow rendering
	- Graphics Misc.
		- H: Add support for 3d textures
		- H: Shadows
		- H: Add inverse frame to camera interface
		- M: Make camera part of the rendering context (reconcile with global camera in renderer)
		- M: Add support to load rendering library objects from assemblies in the new rendering library layout (can keep
		  assembly selector, but it's not necessary anymore)
		- M: Particle systems
		- M: Make the effect assembly load on-demand (i.e. when the effect manager is referenced)
		- M: Add configuration options for effect assembly (or perhaps make this data-driven, so when a CG file is loaded, use CG libraries?)
		- M: Fullscreen mode
		- L: Building the rendering assemblies using the batch file apparently causes a spurious empty "Rendering" directory to be created.
		- L: Multimonitor support
		- L: Refactor opengl texture support routines (move from OpenGlTexture2d)
		- L: Add reporting for AuditedGraphicsFactory

	- Profiling

	- Misc.
		- H: Change name from Poc1 to actual project name! (big job...)
		- H: Add support for multiple functions displayed on a single graph control
		- H: Refactor Poc1.Universe. Create Poc1.Core, Poc1.Terrain, Poc1.Universe
		- H: Add unit-test directory
		- M: Add support for spline, sawtooth, sine wave, bias and gain functions in the graph editor
		- M: Add derived EditorAttribute for setting up texture UI type editor (asset handle creation, mip-mapping)
		- M: Remove fast noise test (move to console app. project in tests directory)
		- L: Refactor Muesli
		- L: Add XML serialization to Muesli

- DISCARD
	- L: Add MRU file list to terrain texture tool (texture tool is amalgamated into planet builder tool)
	- ?: Now that patches are independent of one another (skirts), can use UniPoint as patch centre (unique transform per patch, though) (ground 	displacement breaks skirts)
	- H: Ground displacement requires connected patches, or slightly different skirt rendering (vertical skirts show up) (see new vertex normal skirts)

	- H: Add terrain type builder tab

	- L: Add ground grid as a frame of reference
	- H: Fix blunderbuss spawner - randomise direction vector within cone

	- H: Catch exceptions thrown by asset loads (in solar system construction only...)
	- H: Fix game client to use new rendering library directories
	- H: Create Planet Builder

	- H: Sea
	- M: Add noise to terrain type texture

	- H: Cloud level dependent on planet radius

	- Assets: Design to Game builds
	- Terrain: Multi-threading to queue up patch creation
	- Terrain: Keep terrain patches after they are popped
	- Terrain: Clamp slope 
	- Environment: Simple cloud cover
