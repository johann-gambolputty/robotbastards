	Options in object definitions:

		object: Creates and loads a new object of the specified type
		resource: Loads an object from a resource
			- Load can be deferred until the resource is instanced
		instance: Looks up a model in a model set and creates an instance of that model
			- Maybe have two methods: Model.CreateInstance(), and Model.CreateInstance(Object obj), to instance the model in a pre-defined object?
				(thinking here about sharing data, e.g. BSP for raycasts, pathfinding, rendering)

	To consider:
		When are resources loaded? Can they be streamed as required?
		Would be nice if there was a way to define a model and instance it in the same line (so the model need not be added to a modelSet before it is referenced by an instance)
