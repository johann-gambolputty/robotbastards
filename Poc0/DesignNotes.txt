http://code.google.com/p/robotbastards/issues/list


Environment:
	- Flat arena with vertical walls
	- Shadowed, bump-mapped, multiple light-sources
		- Light-sources constrained to not overlap
	- No physics (beyond simple collision response)
	- Simple UI for showing score + other info, some interactivity (buttons, text box maybe)
	- Windowed only: No fullscreen mode

- Supported players
	- Single player
	- Multiple players over network
	- Bot scripted
	
- Modes
	- Deathmatch
	- Tournaments (persistent scores)
		- Team-based or 1-on-1
			- Team-based will require team builder UI
		- Automated tourneys (for bot-only matches)
		- Tourney API (for learning bots)
		- Tourney options (e.g. no power-ups, for simplified bot-matches)
		
- Wish-list
	- Destructible characters
	- Destructible environments
	- Water dynamics (or, at least, water effects)
	- Non-flat floors
	- More play modes (...)
	
Refactor
	- Rendering contracts
	- Scene contracts
		- Scene + host/view services...
			- Scene services: Update heartbeats (AI/physics), networking
			- View services: Lighting, rendering
			- scene is an object graph only, host contains view-independent services, view contains
			view-dependent services. A scene can have only one host, but many views
			
			Host -1----1-> Scene <-N----1- View

Requirements:
	- Editor
		- Plugins
			- Needs a bit of design thought
			- Edit modes did satisfy requirements, just need a bit more independence from 
		- Runtime bindings to identify graphically editable properties
			- e.g. object position bindings
		- Finish CSG modelling system
			- CSG should define polygon outlines, which are passed to GLU tesselator
				- Can this handle internal double-sided edges?
				- Build up BSP tree when needed (thread)
				- Polygon points can be moved about, leading to re-tesselation
			- Convex region selection
		- Scripting support
		- Remove editor scene support
			- Each layer maintains its own selection of objects (NOT world objects)
				- Editor objects can therefore explicitly set editor specific attributes (e.g. position/orientation), etc.
			- Layers are rendered separately
			- TODO: Keep layer methodology?
			- Runtime scene is built once on export
	- Game Engine
		- Graphics
			- Multiple light-source support
			- Bump-mapping
			- Particle systems
			- Go beyond MD3 format for animation and graphics
			- Simple UI
		- Gameplay
			- Add interface/support library for bot scripting
			- Add interface/support library for level scripting
			- Command input map modification and XML serialization
				- Command input map UI (MVC with WinForms backend for the moment - no in-game UI)
	- Misc
		- Asset pipeline (using CMake/alternative)
		- Tourney setup + team setup UIs (MVC with WinForms backend for the moment - no in-game UI)
